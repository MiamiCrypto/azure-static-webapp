        <h2>Why Cat Sketches?</h2>
        <p>Because cats are the true rulers of the internet, and their sketches deserve a museum of their own. Here, we showcase their quirks, their sass, and their undeniable charm in artistic form. Whether it's a regal pose or a clumsy flop, every stroke of the pencil brings out their personality.</p>
        <p>Scroll through, admire their fluffy brilliance, and if you don’t already have a cat, well… be warned: You might just adopt one after this!</p>
